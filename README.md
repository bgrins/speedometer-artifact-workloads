# Speedometer Artifact Workloads

This is an experiment in code generation for remote [Speedometer](https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/) workloads.

## Building & Running

```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Acknowledgements

This is based on [claude-artifact-runner](https://github.com/claudio-silva/claude-artifact-runner), with some extra machinery to make it easier to collect multiple artifacts, and to make it Speedometer-aware.
